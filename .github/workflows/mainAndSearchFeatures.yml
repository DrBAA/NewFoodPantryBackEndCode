# github action workflow.
# # This workflow automates building and testing for the main and feature branches, including feature-searching.
# # This workflow is triggered on:
#  - Push events to the main branch and feature branches (e.g., feature-searching).
#  - Pull requests targeting the main branch.
# After triggering, it checks out the code, sets up Java (JDK 21), caches Maven dependencies, 
# and runs the Maven build to compile and test the project.
